# Marx - Examination System

## About
Marx is a developmental examination system designed for creating, administering, grading, and analyzing paper-based multiple-choice examinations. It is planned to be a solution focused on features that benefit both students and teachers, such as:

- **Question Pool**: Ability to create a pool of questions for an exam that can be used to generate different forms of the exam, automatically or manually.
- **Exam Creation**: Easy creation of multiple-choice exams with a user-friendly interface.
- **Form Shuffling**: Possibility for each student to receive different forms of different and/or shuffled questions without manual intervention.
- **Exam Administration**: Simple administration of exams using a web interface, allowing examiners to print and distribute generated exam sheets.
- **Grading**: Automatic grading of multiple-choice exam sheets using a printer scanner and image processing with OpenCV.
- **Analysis**: Professional-grade pyschometric analysis of the exam results, including item response theory (IRT) and classical test theory (CTT).

## Development
Marx is currently under development.
